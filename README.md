# Not Soy Sure?
*Not Soy Sure?* is a React Native application developed at HackRice aimed at helping those who cannot eat animal products such as Vegans. The application uses MLKit to recognize the ingredients from the labels of packaged foods and list any that are non-vegan.

## How does it work?
To use, simply take a picture of the ingredients on any package, and the application will display any non-vegan or flagged ingredients.

## How to install
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm`, `react-native`, `cocoa-pods`, `XCode`, and optionally `Android Studio`
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`
4. Navigate to the `ios` folder and run `pod install`
5. Open the `NotSoySure.xcworkspace` in XCode
6. Navigate to the project settings and change the bundle identifier to a unique string
7. Plug in your device and press play!
